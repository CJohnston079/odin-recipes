        <p>You should only feel bad about this one if you're not a dog.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dog food</li>
            <li>Dog treats</li>
            <li>Dog bowl</li>
            <li>Dog</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Tell Milo (the dog) it is his dinner time. Expect excitement.</li>
            <li>Pour the dog food into the dog bowl. Shake it around a little to induce further excitement. <strong>Caution: do not let any escape over the sides!</strong></li>
            <li>Add the dog treats, they act like seasonings for Milo and he may refuse plain food without the incentive. Break large treats into smaller bits.</li>
            <li>Place the bowl on the ground and when Milo is sitting patiently, tell him to "<strong>ATTACK!</strong>".</li>
        </ol>
