First HTML project, my hand is getting warm from being held!

This project will demonstrate my marvellous HTML skills, learned over several minutes of study this morning (plus the boilerplate I memorised last night).

It will showcase my mastery of links, imgages, headings and lists (both unordered and ordered).

Let's get going!
